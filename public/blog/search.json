    "text": "4. How to Fix It (Moving Out of OneDrive)\nIf your project is currently stuck in OneDrive and causing headaches, here is the safe extraction procedure.\n\nStep 1: On Your Primary Computer\nSince your code is pushed to GitHub, it is safe to move the folder.\n\nMove the Folder: Drag your project folder OUT of OneDrive and into a local directory (e.g., ~/Documents/Projects/).\nVerify: Open your terminal and check the status. bash     cd ~/Documents/Projects/my-project     git status\nCleanup: Check OneDrive. If a copy remains there, delete it to stop the sync confusion.\n\n\n\nStep 2: On Your Secondary Computer\nDo not try to “fix” the existing folder on your second computer. It’s faster to start fresh.\n\nLet OneDrive Sync: Wait for OneDrive to update. It should automatically remove the old folder (since you moved/deleted it on Computer 1).\nClone Fresh: Download a clean connection to GitHub in a safe local folder. bash     cd ~/Documents     git clone https://github.com/yourname/my-project.git"
