If a copy remains there, delete it to stop the sync confusion.\n\n\n\nStep 2: On Your Secondary Computer\nDo not try to “fix” the existing folder on your second computer. It’s faster to start fresh.\n\nLet OneDrive Sync: Wait for OneDrive to update. It should automatically remove the old folder.\nClone Fresh: Download a clean connection to GitHub in your safe local folder.\ncd ~/Projects\ngit clone https://github.com/yourname/my-project.git"
