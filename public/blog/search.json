    "section": "2. Taming Randomness",
    "text": "2. Taming Randomness\nStochastic simulations (like MCMC or Molecular Dynamics) are notorious for “it worked once.”\n\nThe Seed Problem\nComputers cannot generate “true” random numbers. They use Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs), which are essentially reading from a fixed, pre-calculated list of numbers. The “seed” tells the computer which page of that book to start reading from. - Seed 0: Starts at page 0 (Sequence: 0.12, 0.88…) - Seed 999: Starts at page 999 (Sequence: 0.76, 0.02…)\nIf you don’t fix the seed, the computer picks a random page based on the current time (nanoseconds). This means your simulation takes a completely different “random walk” every time you run it, making digit-for-digit reproducibility impossible.\nThe “Hidden Seed” Trap: A common mistake is hardcoding the seed deep in a script where it’s invisible to your logs.\n\nBad (Hidden): rng_key = random.PRNGKey(0) inside main.py. Your log just says “Model A ran”, but doesn’t say how.\nGood (Visible): config = {\"seed\": 0, ...}. Your script reads config['seed'], and your log dumps the entire config. Now the seed is explicitly recorded forever.\n\n\n\nThe JAX/NumPyro Solution\nModern frameworks like JAX use explicit key passing. You don’t set a state; you split a key.\nrng_key = random.PRNGKey(0)\nrng_key, subkey = random.split(rng_key)\nresult = run_simulation(subkey)\n\n\nOther Solutions\nIf you aren’t using JAX, you can still achieve this. - NumPy (Modern): Use numpy.random.Generator. Pass the rng object explicitly to functions, rather than relying on np.random. python     rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=42)     val = rng.normal() - Rule of Thumb: Avoid global state. Explicitly pass your source of randomness.\n\nFor R Users\nR relies heavily on global state (set.seed()). To maintain rigor: - Script-Level: Call set.seed(123) at the very top of your main script. - Function-Level: Use withr::with_seed() to isolate randomness within functions. r     withr::with_seed(42, {       run_simulation()     })"

    "text": "5. The “Reproduction Recipe”\nOnce you have these pillars in place, how does someone (or you) actually reproduce the work?\n\nCheckout the Code: Use the Git Hash logged in your results. git checkout &lt;commit_hash&gt;\nRestore the Environment: Use your lockfile. uv sync\nLoad the Config: Take the JSON dump from your config_log.md and use it as the input.\nRun: Execute the script.\n\nBecause you controlled the Code (Git), Parameters (Config), Randomness (Seeds), and Environment (Lockfile), you will get the exact same table 6d."

    "text": "Summary: Toward “Open Science”\nReproducibility is defensive research. You are defending your future self against confusion—and ensuring you can graduate without a last-minute crisis.\n\nLog the Commit Hash (Version Control).\nDump the Config (Parameter Tracking).\nLog the Seed (Stochastic Determinism).\nCodify Data Compiling (Transparent Methodologies).\nLock your Environment (Dependency Rigor).\n\nImplementing these steps moves your work from “runnable scripts” to robust, citeable scientific artifacts—the kind that get papers accepted and theses approved."
