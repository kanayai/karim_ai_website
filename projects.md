## CerTest – Certification for Design: Reshaping the Testing Pyramid
**Website:** [composites-certest.com](https://www.composites-certest.com)

CerTest develops new approaches to enable lighter, more cost and fuel-efficient composite aero-structures. It addresses the challenges that are hindering step-changes in future engineering design by reshaping the testing pyramid.

The project combines world-class expertise from the Universities of Bristol, Bath, Southampton, and Exeter. It aims to reduce empiricism and enable a new integrated approach to design and validation at hitherto unattainable levels of fidelity and design freedom.

**Key Research Challenges:**
1.  Multi-scale Performance Modelling
2.  Features and Damage Characterisation
3.  Data-Rich High Fidelity Structural Characterisation
4.  Integration & Methodology Validation

## GKN Prosperity Partnership
**Website:** [GKN Prosperity Partnership](https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/projects/gkn-prosperity-partnership)

This is a major collaborative research partnership between the University of Bath and GKN Aerospace, funded by the EPSRC.

**Focus Areas:**
The project, often referred to as "Fingerprint", focuses on advancing sustainable aerospace technologies. Key research areas include:
*   **Hydrogen Storage**: Developing solutions for future zero-emission aircraft.
*   **Composite Structures**: Investigating tank boundaries, monocoque structures, and composite parts.
*   **Propulsion Systems**: Researching next-generation propulsion integration.
*   **Material Science**: Advancing functional and structural composite materials.

The partnership brings together expertise from the Departments of Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, and Mathematical Sciences to solve complex engineering challenges.
