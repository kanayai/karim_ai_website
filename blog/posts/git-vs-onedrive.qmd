As Data Scientists using **Mac, Windows, or Linux**, we live in two worlds. We deal with massive datasets (perfect for Cloud Storage) and version-dependent code (perfect for Git).

Deciding where to store a project can be confusing. Make the wrong choice, and you end up with corrupted repositories or lost versions. This guide breaks down exactly where your files belong.

## 1. The Decision Matrix: What Goes Where?

The fundamental difference is simple: **OneDrive syncs the "Now"** (making folders identical across devices), while **GitHub tracks the "History"** (how a file evolved line-by-line).

::: callout-tip
## 🧪 The "Notepad Test" (Rule of Thumb)
Open your file in a basic text editor (Notepad/TextEdit).

*   Can you read it? (Python script, Markdown, CSV) &rarr; **Use GitHub.**
*   Does it look like alien gibberish? (PDF, Excel, .pkl, .exe) &rarr; **Use OneDrive.**
:::

| Feature | OneDrive / Dropbox | GitHub / GitLab |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Best For** | Final Results, Documents, Images | Source Code, Configs, Text |
| **File Types** | Binary (.docx, .pdf, .jpg, .zip) | Plain Text (.py, .R, .md, .tex) |
| **Data Size** | Great for Large Data (>100MB) | Poor for large files (Keep repo < 1GB) |
| **Conflict Handling** | Creates "Conflicted Copy" files | Manual line-by-line merge |

## 2. The "Mirrored" Workflow (Recommended)

For research and data science, you shouldn't choose one or the other. **You need both, but they must remain separate.**

    Cloud["☁️ Cloud Storage
    ~/OneDrive/Data
    (Raw CSVs, Large Zips, Final PDFs)"]

```

### How to link them safely (Mac/Win/Linux safe)

Use code that detects your OS automatically so you don't have to change paths when switching from Mac to Windows.

**R Example:**

```r
# path.expand("~") finds C:/Users/Name (Win) or /Users/Name (Mac)
data_path <- file.path(path.expand("~"), "OneDrive", "Research", "data.csv")
df <- read.csv(data_path)
```

**Python Example:**

```python
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

# Path.home() is the universal way to find the user folder
data_path = Path.home() / "OneDrive" / "Research" / "data.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(data_path)
```

## 3. The Danger Zone: Git INSIDE OneDrive

::: callout-important
## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING
Never initialize a Git repository *inside* a synced OneDrive/Dropbox/iCloud folder.
:::

Why? Sync clients (OneDrive) and Version Control (Git) fight over the hidden `.git` folder. This leads to:

*   **Repo Corruption:** OneDrive may "sync" a file lock that Git needs.
*   **Conflicted Copies:** You will end up with files named `script.py (Computer Name Conflicted Copy)`.

## 4. How to Fix It (Moving Out of OneDrive)

If your project is currently stuck in OneDrive, follow these steps. **Do NOT move it to "Documents"** (as Documents often auto-syncs to Cloud too).

### Step 0: Create a Safe "Projects" Folder

*   **🍎 macOS:** Create `/Users/name/Projects` (Do not put in Documents!)
*   **🪟 Windows:** Create `C:\Users\name\Projects` (Do not put in Documents!)
*   **🐧 Linux:** Create `/home/name/Projects` (Safe anywhere in ~)

### Step 1: On Your Primary Computer

1.  **Move the Folder:** Drag your project folder **OUT** of OneDrive and into your new `Projects` folder.
2.  **Verify:** Open your terminal (Git Bash on Windows).

    ```text
    cd ~/Projects/my-project
    git status
    ```
3.  **Cleanup:** Check OneDrive. If a copy remains there, delete it to stop the sync confusion.

### Step 2: On Your Secondary Computer

Do not try to "fix" the existing folder on your second computer. It's faster to start fresh.

1.  **Let OneDrive Sync:** Wait for OneDrive to update. It should automatically remove the old folder.
2.  **Clone Fresh:** Download a clean connection to GitHub in your safe local folder.

    ```text
    cd ~/Projects
    git clone https://github.com/yourname/my-project.git
    ```

## Summary

*   **Code** lives in **~/Projects** (Git).
*   **Data** lives in **~/OneDrive** (Cloud).
*   **Never** put Git inside OneDrive or Documents (if synced).
